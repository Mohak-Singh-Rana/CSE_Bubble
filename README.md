# CSE_Bubble

This is a course project under Prof. Urbi Chatterjee, Dept. of CSE, IIT Kanpur.</br ></br>

CSE Bubble is a **processor** that executes **MIPS code** in 5 stages, namely Instruction Fetch Phase, Decoding Phase, Memory Access Phase, Arithmetic Logic Unit phase and Memory Write phase.</br >
(i)**Instruction Fetch Phase**: Instruction are fetched from the instruction memory</br >
(ii)**Decoding Phase**: Instruction are decoded according to their opcode and func value</br >
(iii)**Memory Access Phase**: Data is fetched from the Main memory </br >
(iv)**Arithmetic Logic Unit phase**: Operations are performed depending on the instruction type</br >
(v)**Memory Write phase**: Output from the ALU is written accordingly in the main memory</br >
